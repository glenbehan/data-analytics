## Question 2
	‘The benefits of AI outweigh the limitations’. Do you agree with this statement? Discuss and justify with reference to examples of benefits and limitations. (25m)

### Answer

The advantages of AI indisputably surpass its limitations. AI has emerged as a transformation force across industries, revolutionizing healthcare, enhancing productivity, and fostering innovation.

In healthcare, AI facilitates early disease detection through advanced diagnostics, enabling more effective and personalized treatments. For example, machine learning algorithms analyze medical images swiftly and accurately, significantly improving patient outcomes.

In various industries, AI optimizes processes, driving efficiency and cost-effectiveness. Autonomous systems powered by AI, such as self-driving cars, promise safer transportation, reducing accidents caused by human error.

While some concerns exist, such as biases in AI systems, ongoing efforts are actively addressing these issues. Transparency and fairness initiatives aim to mitigate biases in AI algorithms, ensuring equitable decision-making. Moreover, strides are being made to develop more explainable AI models, enhancing trust and understanding of their decision-making processes.

The argument of job displacement due to automation is countered by the creation of new job opportunities. AI not only replaces mundane tasks but also opens avenues for high-skilled positions, stimulating economic growth and innovation.

Policies and regulations are being formulated to guide the ethical use of AI, ensuring responsible deployment and minimizing potential risks. The commitment to ethical AI practices aligns with the collective goal of harnessing AI's immense potential while safeguarding against misuse.

In conclusion, the myriad benefits of AI, from improved healthcare to increased efficiency across industries, outweigh its limitations. With continued innovation and responsible governance, AI holds the promise of a brighter, more advanced future for humanity.

## Question 3A. 

Describe the disadvantages (limitations) to Natural Language Processing (NPL) applications (15m)

Certainly! Natural Language Processing (NLP) has revolutionized various fields, but it also comes with certain limitations:


### Answer

Ambiguity and Context: Language is highly context-dependent and can be ambiguous. NLP models often struggle with understanding nuances, idiomatic expressions, sarcasm, and context shifts, leading to misinterpretation.

Data Limitations and Bias: NLP models heavily rely on large datasets, and biases present in the data can get amplified, resulting in biased predictions or outputs, affecting fairness and equity in applications.

Lack of Common Sense Understanding: NLP models lack inherent common-sense knowledge, struggling with reasoning beyond the presented text. Understanding implicit information or making logical inferences is challenging.

Computational Resources: Training large-scale NLP models requires substantial computational power and memory, making it expensive and inaccessible for many researchers or organizations.

b.	Discuss potential solutions to the ethical considerations (10m)

Privacy and Ethical Concerns: NLP deals with sensitive textual data, raising concerns about privacy, data security, and ethical use, especially in applications like sentiment analysis or text generation.

## Extra Questions

### Question
Draw a ANN (Artificial Neral Network) and label and Explain the diagram.

#### Answer

![ann diagram](ann-diagram.png)

This diagram illustrates an Artificial Neural Network (ANN). The leftmost circles represent input nodes conveying data to interconnected neurons via weighted connections (edges). Within the network, these inputs are multiplied by respective weights, summed up along with a bias term, and processed by an activation function within each neuron. The resulting output, typically between 0 and 1, emerges from the network.
